# Cross-Site Ceph Replication for Disaster Recovery

## Scenario Description
Implement a multi-site Ceph cluster with asynchronous replication between geographically distributed datacenters, focusing on disaster recovery capabilities.

### Key Components
- Multi-site Ceph configuration
- Asynchronous replication
- Network optimization
- Backup management

### Implementation Files
1. Multi-site Configuration:
```yaml:examples/storage/ceph-multisite.yaml
startLine: 1
endLine: 22
```

2. Network QoS:
```yaml:examples/ceph/disaster-recovery/network-qos.yaml
startLine: 1
endLine: 25
```

### Network Requirements
- Dedicated replication network
- Bandwidth guarantees
- Traffic prioritization
- Latency monitoring

### Recovery Procedures
1. Automated failover testing
2. Data consistency validation
3. Network failback procedures
